# google speech to text punctuation
What punctuation can I speak to my phone? Here's what I've found.

These replacements are flaky; they sometimes work, sometimes don't. Some of them work better in some contexts than in others; for example many of them if said on their own will be interpreted as a word, but if said with other words will be interpreted as punctuation between those other words.

Suggestions (issue/pull requests) are welcome, but I will only add them if they at least occasionally work when I personally try them.

If punctuation is added or removed, the history of this repo should provide some idea of when it was done, or at least when I became aware of it.
